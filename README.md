TempFileDrop.io is a project that replicates [file.io](https://www.file.io/) which is a super simple file sharing application.
The purpose of this project is to understand the mechanics behind building an object storage service application. The following
tech stack will be applied:
- **React** - front facing website
- **Nginx** - Web server to serve website
- **MinIO** - object storage server

## Architecture Design

### Design Considerations

1. How much space do we need for the MinIO Cluster
2. API Service
    - Batch Calls
    - Speed of transfer
    - Mode of transfer
    - How much load can it handles
