# StorageFileDropzone

This is a StorageFileDropzone component built on top of `react-dropzone` and `material-ui`. Refer to [https://react-dropzone.js.org/](https://react-dropzone.js.org/)
for more information. **This component is built specifically for storage service API where it uses storage-js-client for
uploading files to the API**. Refer to the documentation below on how to implement this component.

<Story id="components-storagefiledropzone--basic" />

<br />

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Import the library and the required dependencies.
    ```bash
    yarn add storage-component-library axios moment
    ```
2. Add the component to your react project.
    ```javascript
    import { StorageFileDropzone } from "storage-component-library";

    const App = () => {
        return <StorageFileDropzone />;
    };
    ```

### Normal Upload

The storage service API requires **Upload Metadata** when uploading files. This is provided in the form of a `json` object.
The format of the metadata is as follows:

```javascript
export interface UploadMetadata {
    bucket: string;
    storagePath: string;
    eventRoutingKey: string;
    eventData?: string;
}
```

You can also provide **Maximum Download Count**, **Expiry Period** and **Allow Anonymous Download** settings for the uploaded
files. Show these settings in the component by enabling the parameter `showConfigs=true`. Below is an example on how you can
implement the component for normal upload:

```javascript
import { StorageFileDropzone } from "storage-component-library";

const App = () => {
    const handleUploadSuccess = () => {
        console.log("Upload Success!");
    };

    const handleUploadError = (err: any) => {
        console.log("Upload Error!");
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <StorageFileDropzone
                showConfigs={true}
                uploadMetadata={{
                    bucket: "example",
                    storagePath: "/example",
                    eventRoutingKey: "example",
                    eventData: JSON.stringify({ example: "example" })
                }}
                onSuccessfulUploadCallback={handleUploadSuccess}
                onErrorCallback={handleUploadError}
            />
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Anonymous Upload

The storage service API provides an **anonymous upload endpoint** which is useful when the uploader does not have the
required permissions. Hence, uploader can use the anonymous endpoint for upload / download without any authorization
required. Refer to the code snippet below on how you can implement the component for anonymous upload:

```javascript
import { StorageFileDropzone } from "storage-component-library";

const App = () => {
    const handleUploadSuccess = () => {
        console.log("Upload Success!");
    };

    const handleUploadError = (err: any) => {
        console.log("Upload Error!");
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <StorageFileDropzone
                isAnonymousUpload={true}
                onSuccessfulUploadCallback={handleUploadSuccess}
                onErrorCallback={handleUploadError}
            />
        </div>
    );
};
```
